# Universal Tabletop System

The Universal Tabletop System for FoundryVTT, by Metamorphic Digital.

## System Features

This bare-bones system provides a stable platform for module developers to add their own functionality by registering data models and other functionality without needing to build an entire system.

Benefits include
- Actor and Item sheets that automatically display properties based on the data models
- A combat tracker that supports assigning initiative to players, not just actors
- Expanded range of hooks
